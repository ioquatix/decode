# Decode

A Ruby code analysis tool and documentation generator.

[![Development](https://github.com/ioquatix/decode/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ioquatix/decode/actions?workflow=Development)

## Motivation

As part of my effort to build [better project documentation](https://github.com/socketry/utopia-project), I needed a better code analysis tool. While less featured than some of the more mature alternatives, this library focuses on the needs of documentation generation, including speed, cross-referencing and (eventually) multi-language support.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://ioquatix.github.io/decode/).
