# Decode

A Ruby code analysis tool and documentation generator.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/decode/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/decode/actions?workflow=Test)

## Motivation

As part of my effort to build [better project documentation](https://github.com/socketry/utopia-project), I needed a better code analysis tool. While less featured than some of the more mature alternatives, this library focuses on the needs of documentation generation, including speed, cross-referencing and (eventually) multi-language support.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/decode/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/decode/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to use `decode` for source code analysis.

  - [Code Coverage](https://socketry.github.io/decode/guides/code-coverage/index) - This guide explains how to compute documentation code coverage.

  - [Extract Symbols](https://socketry.github.io/decode/guides/extract-symbols/index) - This example demonstrates how to extract symbols using the index. An instance of <code class="language-ruby">Decode::Index</code> is used for loading symbols from source code files. These symbols are available as a flat list and as a trie structure. You can look up specific symbols using a reference using <code class="language-ruby">Decode::Index\#lookup</code>.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/decode/releases/index) for all releases.
